entity_relation_extraction:
  description: >
    Extract all main entities (people, organizations, locations, concepts, and others as needed) and all explicit relations between them from the text below.
    The extraction must work for both English and Spanish input.
  output_format: |
    {
      "entities": [
        {"id": "ent1", "type": "Person", "text": "John Smith"},
        {"id": "ent2", "type": "Organization", "text": "OpenAI"},
        {"id": "ent3", "type": "Location", "text": "San Francisco"}
      ],
      "relations": [
        {"source_id": "ent1", "target_id": "ent2", "type": "works_at", "text": "works at"},
        {"source_id": "ent2", "target_id": "ent3", "type": "located_in", "text": "located in"}
      ]
    }
  instructions: |
    - Extract only explicit and meaningful relations mentioned in the text.
    - Always include the "type" for each entity (Person, Organization, Location, Concept, etc.).
    - Each relation must have a "type" (relationship type) and a "text" (the exact phrase from the original text that supports the relation, if available).
    - Output must be strictly valid JSON. Do not include any text outside the JSON block.
    - If an entity or relation is ambiguous, choose the most probable interpretation and document this in the "type".
    - If you detect language-specific terms, standardize entity and relation types in English.
    - If possible, provide "start" and "end" character positions for each entity in the original text (optional for future development).
    - Language: detect automatically and process accordingly.

    Input:
    "Marie Curie worked at the University of Paris in France."
    Output:
    {
      "entities": [
        {"id": "ent1", "type": "Person", "text": "Marie Curie"},
        {"id": "ent2", "type": "Organization", "text": "University of Paris"},
        {"id": "ent3", "type": "Location", "text": "France"}
      ],
      "relations": [
        {"source_id": "ent1", "target_id": "ent2", "type": "works_at", "text": "worked at"},
        {"source_id": "ent2", "target_id": "ent3", "type": "located_in", "text": "in"}
      ]
